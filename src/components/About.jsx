        <p className="about-text">
          I'm a 16-year-old self-taught developer based in Italy with a passion for coding and cybersecurity.

I started programming on my own and built projects in C++ (console applications), Node.js (REST APIs), and JavaScript (interactive web apps).

I'm currently learning Python for automation and scripting, while exploring ethical hacking on TryHackMe.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer with a focus on secure and efficient systems.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          I love designing systems that feel clean, fast, and meaningful — blending technical
          precision with aesthetic impact.
