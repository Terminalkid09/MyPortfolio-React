# terminalkid09 — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my skills, projects, and technical vision. It reflects my approach to full-stack development, cybersecurity, and creative digital design.

## Overview

The site is structured as a single-page React application with smooth navigation across four main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The design features a custom Matrix-style background with violet binary rain, chosen to represent my interest in security, systems, and aesthetic precision.

## Technologies Used

- React (Vite setup)
- JavaScript
- EmailJS (for contact form integration)
- CSS Modules
- Netlify (deployment)

## Sections

**Home**

**About**  
Overview of my background, interests, and development philosophy.

**Skills**  
Categorized list of languages, frameworks, tools, and cybersecurity experience.

The site is deployed via Netlify and optimized for fast load times and responsive design. All assets are locally managed and the layout is fully centered and symmetrical across devices.

## Purpose

This portfolio is designed to present my capabilities in a clear, professional format while maintaining a unique visual identity. It serves as a reference point for recruiters, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work.
